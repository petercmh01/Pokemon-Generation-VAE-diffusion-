# **Pokemon Generation with VAE and Diffusion**

This project is developed as part of the MUST Data Science class. It provides an open-source tool for training and generating Pokemon-like images using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion Models.

## **Features**
- **VAE Training**: Efficiently train a Variational Autoencoder for generating compressed latent representations.
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate Pokemon images using denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

## **Installation**
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment for the project. Then, install the required dependencies:  
`pip install torch torchvision`  
`pip install denoising_diffusion_pytorch`
`pip install pytorch-fid`
